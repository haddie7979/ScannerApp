## Accomplished
We were able to accomplish everything we planned to do. We were successful in setting up account creation for users, as well as the ability to login to the website. This includes the authentication and authorization of the accounts. We also completed the setup for storing the allergen and dietary preferences that the users select.
## Didn't Work
We accomplished all of the issues that we set out to address. We did not manage to complete more than we planned, but we did achieve the goals we set at the beginning of this sprint. This is likely because we set realistic expectations for this sprint, taking into account the learning curve that comes with beginning a new project.
